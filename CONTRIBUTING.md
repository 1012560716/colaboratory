## Pull Requests

Some guidelines on contributing to coLaboratory:

* All work is submitted via Pull Requests.
* Pull Requests can be submitted as soon as there is code worth discussing.
  Pull Requests track the branch, so you can continue to work after the PR is submitted.
  Review and discussion can begin well before the work is complete,
  and the more discussion the better.
  The worst case is that the PR is closed.
* Pull Requests should usually be merged by someone other than the submitter, and
  should include relevant people as reviewers see issue #56.  If you are new to
  the project, just include anyone who can merge the PR, and they will figure out
  who else should be reviewing.
* Pull Requests should generally be made against master
